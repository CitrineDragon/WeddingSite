	<h3>How We Met</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Like many modern love stories, ours began with a few swipes and a spark of curiosity — on a dating app called OkCupid.<br><br>
    What started as a simple message turned into thoughtful conversations, shared laughs, and the realization that we might just have something special. After chatting for a week, we decided to meet in person — over sushi, of course.
    That first date was filled with easy conversation, nervous smiles, and a sense of comfort that felt surprisingly natural. We didn’t know it then, but that dinner would be the start of something that would change both of our lives.<br><br>
    From sushi to road trips, cozy nights in to big life changes, our journey has been full of love, laughter, and the kind of connection you only find once in a lifetime.</p>
