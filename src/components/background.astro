	<h3>About the Groom</h3>
  <div>
    <h2>Alexander Yi</h2>
    <p>Alexander Sok Yi is the son of Alexander Yi Sr. and Kay Om. He was born and raised in Orange County, California, and grew up in a loving home alongside his younger sister Christina and younger brother Julius.
    Alex is a proud U.S. Army Airborne Infantry Veteran who was stationed at Ft. Richardson Alaska. During his 5 years of duty, he went on two tours. 15 months in Fallujah, Iraq and another 12 months in Afghanistan — experiences that shaped his quiet strength, resilience, and deep sense of purpose.<br><br>
    Off the battlefield, Alex is known for his thoughtful nature and sense of humor. He finds joy in early tee times on the golf course, good conversation, and time spent with family and friends.
    Meeting Anh brought new joy into his life — a partner who brings warmth, laughter, and creativity to every day. Together, they’ve built a love rooted in mutual respect, shared values, and unwavering support for one another.

	<h3>How We Met</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Like many modern love stories, ours began with a few swipes and a spark of curiosity — on a dating app called OkCupid.<br><br>
    What started as a simple message turned into thoughtful conversations, shared laughs, and the realization that we might just have something special. After chatting for a week, we decided to meet in person — over sushi, of course.
    That first date was filled with easy conversation, nervous smiles, and a sense of comfort that felt surprisingly natural. We didn’t know it then, but that dinner would be the start of something that would change both of our lives.<br><br>
    From sushi to road trips, cozy nights in to big life changes, our journey has been full of love, laughter, and the kind of connection you only find once in a lifetime.</p>
