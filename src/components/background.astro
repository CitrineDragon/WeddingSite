	<h3>About the Bride</h3>
  <div>
    <h2>Anh Mai</h2>
    <p>Ngoc Anh Thi Mai is the daughter of Tuoi Van Mai and Hoa Thi Nguyen, and the older sister to Jeannie Mai. Born and raised in San Diego, California, Anh grew up surrounded by love, tradition, and a strong sense of family — values she holds close to this day.<br><br>
    Anh is known for her warmth, creativity, and the genuine way she connects with others. She brings light into every room, finds meaning in the little things, and lives life with both heart and intention.
    At home, she’s never far from her two beloved Maltese pups, Maikey and Bunny — her fluffy companions who bring daily joy (and occasional chaos) into her world.<br><br>
    From her roots in San Diego to the life she’s now building with Alex, Anh embraces each chapter with grace and excitement. She is endlessly grateful for the journey that brought her here — and for the loved ones who will be there to witness this new beginning.</p>

	<h3>How We Met</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Like many modern love stories, ours began with a few swipes and a spark of curiosity — on a dating app called OkCupid.<br><br>
    What started as a simple message turned into thoughtful conversations, shared laughs, and the realization that we might just have something special. After chatting for a week, we decided to meet in person — over sushi, of course.
    That first date was filled with easy conversation, nervous smiles, and a sense of comfort that felt surprisingly natural. We didn’t know it then, but that dinner would be the start of something that would change both of our lives.<br><br>
    From sushi to road trips, cozy nights in to big life changes, our journey has been full of love, laughter, and the kind of connection you only find once in a lifetime.</p>
